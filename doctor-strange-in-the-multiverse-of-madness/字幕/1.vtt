01:03.310 --> 01:04.310
已經幹掉它了嗎？
Did that kill it?

01:04.320 --> 01:05.060
沒有
No.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.580
我們需要那個來殺死它
That's how we kill it.

01:10.650 --> 01:12.150
維山帝之書
The Book of Vishanti!

01:15.860 --> 01:18.120
不能讓它奪走你的能力 快去拿書
We can't let it take your power. Get to the book.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.280
要怎麼過去？
How do we get across?

01:19.450 --> 01:20.370
跳
Jump.

01:23.870 --> 01:24.710
抓緊
Hold on!

01:26.920 --> 01:29.040
不…
No, no, no!

02:08.960 --> 02:10.460
它太強大了
It's too strong.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.250
我制服不了它
I can't hold it.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.450
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

02:40.070 --> 02:41.280
這是唯一的辦法
This is the only way.

02:44.450 --> 02:45.450
你在做什麼？
What're you doing?

02:45.620 --> 02:47.540
我不能讓那怪物奪走你的能力
I can't let that thing take your power.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.580
你控制不了你的能力
You can't control it.

02:50.710 --> 02:52.130
但我可以
But I can.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.960
我們是朋友啊
But we're friends.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.420
你為何要殺死我
You're killing me.

02:56.590 --> 02:57.670
我知道
I know.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.720
但在放眼整個多元宇宙的龐大世界裡
But in the grand calculus of the Multiverse...

03:01.890 --> 03:03.850
你犧牲的價值超過你的…
your sacrifice is worth more than your...

04:28.390 --> 04:30.180
借過
Excuse me. May I?

04:30.350 --> 04:31.350
謝謝
Thanks.

04:51.700 --> 04:52.960
斯特蘭奇博士
Doctor Strange.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.290
韋斯特博士
Doctor West.

04:55.540 --> 04:57.250
有一陣子沒見了
Haven't seen you in a while.

04:57.420 --> 05:01.460
我有五年變成塵埃
Yeah, I was a little preoccupied being dust there for five years, so...

05:01.630 --> 05:03.130
很多人也是
So were a lot of us.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.510
我不在的時候…
While I was gone...

05:08.300 --> 05:09.850
謝謝關心
thank you for asking...

05:10.890 --> 05:12.680
我失去了兩隻貓
I lost both my cats...

05:15.940 --> 05:17.270
和我弟弟
and my brother.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.980
很遺憾
I'm very sorry.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.280
謝謝
Thank you.

05:29.950 --> 05:32.950
晚上睡不著時我常在想
I guess what keeps me up at night is wondering...

05:33.750 --> 05:35.710
非得那樣慘烈不可嗎？
did it have to happen that way?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.790
有沒有別的路可行？
Was there any other path?

05:43.420 --> 05:44.670
沒有
No.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.680
我用了僅有的方法
No, I made the only play we had.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.800
那當然
Well, of course you did.

05:51.510 --> 05:54.560
一流外科醫師又是最棒的超級英雄
The best surgeon and the best superhero.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.810
但你還是沒擄獲佳人芳心
But you still didn't get the girl.

06:49.990 --> 06:51.240
麻煩一杯紅酒
Glass of red, please.

06:51.410 --> 06:52.410
我來效勞 小姐
Oh, allow me, miss.

06:55.330 --> 06:56.410
太沒創意了？
Little too on the nose?

06:56.580 --> 06:58.250
你 在我婚禮上？
What? For you, at my wedding?

06:58.410 --> 07:00.040
不 我覺得很完美
Nah. I think it was perfect.

07:00.790 --> 07:01.920
恭喜
Congratulations.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.210
謝謝
Thank you.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.210
查理來了
There's Charlie.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.590
介紹你認識 因為他…
I have to introduce you because he's kind of...

07:07.760 --> 07:10.840
有點丟臉 他是鐵粉
It's embarrassing, but he's a big fan, so...

07:11.010 --> 07:12.050
克裡斯汀
Hey, Christine.

07:14.050 --> 07:15.060
我應該…
I should've...

07:17.930 --> 07:19.100
真希望當初不是那樣
I wish I'd have been different.

07:19.890 --> 07:22.230
我始終關心著我們倆
I never stopped caring about us.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.480
但我必須做出犧牲…
But I had to make sacrifices...

07:25.270 --> 07:26.780
才能保護你
to protect you.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.490
對不起
I'm sorry.

07:32.950 --> 07:34.990
我們之間根本不可能
It was never gonna work out between us.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.620
為什麼？
Why not?

07:38.790 --> 07:40.660
因為 史蒂芬
Because, Stephen...

07:40.830 --> 07:43.130
你非得掌控一切不可
you have to be the one holding the knife.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.250
我一向尊重你 卻無法因此愛你
And I always respected you for it, but I couldn't love you for it.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.840
這句話你忍了多久？
How long you had that one in the barrel?

07:56.260 --> 07:57.310
很久了
Long time.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.390
我想也是
Yeah. I bet.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.560
聽著
Look...

08:02.230 --> 08:04.810
我真的很高興你找到幸福
Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.030
我很幸福
I am.

08:09.150 --> 08:10.280
真的很幸福
I really, really am.

08:10.820 --> 08:11.820
那就好
Good.

08:12.910 --> 08:13.910
你呢？
Are you?

08:14.490 --> 08:15.870
我很幸福
I'm happy.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.450
那就好
Good.

08:17.910 --> 08:19.240
你值得幸福
You deserve it.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.880
小心 那是什麼？
Oh, man. Look out! What is that?

08:32.590 --> 08:33.880
老兄
Dude!

08:41.560 --> 08:42.560
謝謝
Thank you.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.430
哇
Wow!

09:30.360 --> 09:31.400
不
No, no.

09:45.290 --> 09:46.290
小心
Look out!

09:57.300 --> 09:58.300
我認識你嗎？
Do I know you?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.450
救命啊
Help!

11:49.160 --> 11:50.160
別客氣
You're welcome.

11:50.870 --> 11:54.130
知道向至尊魔法師鞠躬是古老習俗嗎
You know it's ancient custom to bow in the presence of the Sorcerer Supreme?

11:54.290 --> 11:56.340
我知道那個習俗
Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.

12:02.550 --> 12:03.510
撐住
Hold it, hold it!

12:30.200 --> 12:31.370
不可思議
That's incredible.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.790
是啊
Yeah.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.170
天啊
Oh, God!

13:34.810 --> 13:35.810
她是誰？
Who's this?

13:35.980 --> 13:37.100
我正想問同樣的問題
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

13:37.270 --> 13:38.610
小鬼
Hey, kid.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.110
那隻怪獸為什麼要追你？
What did that creature want with you?

13:40.270 --> 13:41.280
你父母呢？
Where're your parents?

13:41.440 --> 13:42.610
我們送她回…
We'll take her back to the...

13:46.070 --> 13:47.070
她拿走我的懸戒
She took my Slingie.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.030
她拿走你的懸戒
She took your Slingie.

13:53.410 --> 13:55.210
太誇張了
Yeah, it was crazy, man.

13:55.750 --> 13:56.920
天啊
Oh, my God!

13:58.420 --> 14:00.290
我不會殺你 小鬼
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.880
我拼了命想救你 記得嗎？
I just bust my ass trying to save your life, remember?

14:05.470 --> 14:07.340
巨獸我能對付
Giant monsters I can clearly handle...

14:07.510 --> 14:10.760
困擾我的是昨晚你出現在我夢裡
but what bothers me is that last night, you were in my dream.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.390
那不是夢
That wasn't a dream.

14:14.890 --> 14:16.440
那是另一個宇宙
It was another universe.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.730
你們有多少多重宇宙的經驗？
How much experience do you guys have with the Multiverse?

14:22.400 --> 14:23.780
我們有多重宇宙的經驗
We have experience of the Multiverse.

14:23.940 --> 14:26.030
最近有件事與蜘蛛俠有關
Most recently, there was an incident with Spider-Man.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.450
什麼人？
What man?

14:27.610 --> 14:30.410
-蜘蛛俠 他有蜘蛛的超能力　-所以叫蜘蛛俠
-Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider. -Hence the name.

14:30.660 --> 14:31.830
好噁心
Gross.

14:31.990 --> 14:32.990
他長得像蜘蛛嗎？
Does he look like a spider?

14:33.160 --> 14:34.120
不 比較像人
No. No, more like a man.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.330
爬牆 射蜘蛛網
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.750
-答對了　-從屁股射嗎？
-Yeah. Bingo. -Out of his butt?

14:36.910 --> 14:38.170
不是　-不是
-No. -No.

14:38.330 --> 14:39.670
也許吧 我也不知道
Well, maybe, I don't know.

14:39.830 --> 14:40.830
我真心希望不是
Honestly, I hope not.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.040
超詭異
Super weird.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.130
這樣吃會肚子痛
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.840
我來自另一個宇宙
I'm from another universe.

14:47.010 --> 14:48.680
你怎麼知道我的肚子跟你一樣？
How do you know my stomach works the same as yours?

14:48.840 --> 14:50.010
不知道
I don't.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.390
我根本不知道你是否來自另一個宇宙
I don't even know if you're from another universe...

14:52.550 --> 14:55.600
所以我還坐在這裡等你啟發我們
which is why I'm still sitting here, waiting for you to enlighten us.

14:55.850 --> 14:56.680
我不得不說
Gotta say,

14:57.430 --> 14:59.060
目前我見過的兩個奇異博士
of the two Doctor Stranges I've met so far...

14:59.730 --> 15:00.690
你不是我最喜歡的
you're not my favorite.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.310
什麼意思？
Which means?

15:03.610 --> 15:04.980
他不懂西班牙語嗎？
Does he not know Spanish?

15:05.400 --> 15:07.900
我連他愛不愛說英語都不清楚
I'm not sure he even enjoys speaking English.

15:08.570 --> 15:10.490
我離開一場美麗的婚禮
Look, I left a very nice wedding...

15:10.660 --> 15:13.410
去救一個小屁孩 以免她被章魚吃掉
to save a smart-ass kid from getting eaten by an octopus.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.990
-誰的婚禮？　-克裡斯汀
-Whose wedding? -Now tell me... Christine's.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.790
-你去了？　-靠 你娶了克裡斯汀？
-You went? -Holy shit, you married Christine?

15:16.950 --> 15:17.790
-能拍照嗎？　-不能
-Do you mind? -Yes, I do.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.790
我沒有 對
No, I didn't. Yes.

15:19.290 --> 15:21.500
你得跟我解釋怎麼回事
You need to explain to me what's going on.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.750
那只章魚為什麼想吃你？
Why was that octopus trying to eat you?

15:23.920 --> 15:25.670
那怪物想綁架我
That thing was trying to kidnap me.

15:26.670 --> 15:29.170
它就像惡魔的爪牙
It's like a henchman who works for a demon.

15:29.340 --> 15:32.010
我們只知道他們想奪走我的能力
All we knew is that they wanted to take my power for themselves.

15:32.180 --> 15:33.350
什麼能力？
What power?

15:34.930 --> 15:36.390
我能在多重宇宙間旅行
I can travel the Multiverse.

15:36.970 --> 15:37.980
什麼？
What?

15:38.140 --> 15:40.350
你能在不同宇宙間移動？
You can physically move from one universe to another?

15:40.940 --> 15:41.770
怎麼做？
How?

15:41.850 --> 15:43.650
問題就是我不知道
That's the problem. I don't know how.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.070
我無法控制它
Can't control it.

15:45.230 --> 15:47.230
只有在我非常害怕時才有辦法
Only happens when I'm really, really afraid.

15:47.940 --> 15:51.530
我的分身能擊敗這個惡魔嗎？
Okay. And did Other Me know how to defeat this demon?

15:51.700 --> 15:54.660
你們知道一本白魔法全書
Well, you guys knew of this magical book of pure good...

15:54.830 --> 15:57.870
它給魔法師擊敗敵人所需的指引
that gives a sorcerer whatever they need to defeat their enemy.

15:58.370 --> 16:00.080
維山帝之書？
The Book of Vishanti?

16:00.540 --> 16:01.670
那不是真的
It's not real.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.130
那是神話 不存在
It's a fairy tale. It doesn't exist.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.290
其實它存在
Actually, it does.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.920
成為至尊魔法師時拿到的秘笈中有寫
I found out in the secret book you get when you become Sorcerer Supreme.

16:09.090 --> 16:10.130
不可思議
Unbelievable.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.590
你不是至尊魔法師？
You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?

16:11.760 --> 16:13.510
我不是至尊魔法師
No, I'm not the Sorcerer Supreme.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.390
你的分身是他那個宇宙的至尊魔法師
Other You was Sorcerer Supreme of his universe.

16:15.550 --> 16:16.430
是
Right. Yeah.

16:16.510 --> 16:18.100
雖然它存在
Although it does exist...

16:18.270 --> 16:20.310
維山帝之書據說無法取得
the Book of Vishanti is said to be unreachable.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.940
沒錯 只是…
It is. Except...

16:24.100 --> 16:25.110
我們取得了
we reached it.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.860
結果那個惡魔追上我們
Then the demon caught up with us.

16:29.070 --> 16:31.700
我以為你會保護我 可是…
I thought you'd protect me...

16:34.570 --> 16:35.450
你沒有
but you didn't.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.160
那是我夢中的那場打鬥
That was the fight in my dream.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.080
那不是夢
That wasn't a dream.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.120
證明給我看
Prove it.

16:50.590 --> 16:51.970
那不是夢
It wasn't a dream.

16:59.220 --> 17:00.470
這表示…
That means...

17:02.270 --> 17:05.060
夢境是窺探多重宇宙自我的窗口
dreams are windows into the lives of our Multiversal selves.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.900
那是他的理論
That was his theory.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.940
所以我裸體被小丑追的惡夢…
So, that recurring nightmare where I'm running naked from a clown...

17:12.690 --> 17:14.570
在某個地方是真的
Somewhere out there, it's real.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.490
我在那個地方綁馬尾
Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.160
可能會有更多怪獸來追殺她
There could be more creatures coming for her.

17:21.330 --> 17:23.500
這能力在小鬼手中就夠危險了
The power is dangerous enough in the hands of a kid.

17:23.660 --> 17:24.960
要是被真正的威脅取得呢？
Imagine if a real threat acquired it?

17:27.580 --> 17:30.050
對了 年輕人 我們不知道你名字
It occurs to me, young one, we don't know your name.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.680
阿美莉卡查維茲
America Chavez.

17:34.840 --> 17:38.050
查小姐 願意跟我們到卡瑪泰姬嗎？
Miss Chavez, will you come with us to Kamar-Taj?

17:38.220 --> 17:39.430
你在那裡會很安全
You'll be safe there.

17:40.220 --> 17:42.310
我怎麼知道你不會跟他一樣背叛我？
How do I know you won't betray me like he did?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.440
我想你只能相信我了
I guess you're just gonna have to trust me.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.730
該拿他怎麼辦？
What do we do with him?

17:59.490 --> 18:00.950
這樣違反規定
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.580
我埋過更糟的
Ah, I've buried worse.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.620
殺死他的怪獸…
The creature that killed him...

18:07.790 --> 18:09.790
有跟那只章魚一樣的記號嗎？
did it have the same markings as the octopus?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.000
盧恩符文
Runes.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.300
這不是魔法
This isn't sorcery.

18:14.630 --> 18:15.630
是巫術
It's witchcraft.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.640
有誰面對過這種東西嗎？
Do we know anyone who's faced such a thing?

18:21.850 --> 18:22.970
我可能知道
I think I might.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.350
巧克力
Chocolate!

18:26.480 --> 18:27.980
我說什麼？
Hey! What did I say?

18:28.150 --> 18:29.190
我們等不及了
But we couldn't wait.

18:29.350 --> 18:30.610
我怎麼說的？
But what did I say?

18:34.230 --> 18:36.110
去洗手
Go wash your hands.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.910
媽 別這樣 我們年紀太大了
Mom, come on. We're too old for that.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.250
好吧
Oh, okay.

18:45.410 --> 18:46.500
你能幫我蓋被子 媽
You can tuck me in, Mom.

18:47.290 --> 18:48.330
沒問題
I will.

18:51.670 --> 18:55.380
你知道 家人是永遠的
You know, a family is forever.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.380
就算想 我們也不可能真的離開彼此
We could never truly leave each other, even if we tried.

18:59.550 --> 19:01.470
媽 我改變心意了
Mom, I changed my mind.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.720
你要的話可以幫我蓋被子
You can come tuck me in if you want.

19:03.890 --> 19:05.060
好
Okay.

19:09.020 --> 19:10.270
愛你
Love you.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.640
蘋果 對吧？
Apples, right?

19:43.970 --> 19:45.220
最後會長出來
Eventually.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.400
-聞起來…　-香甜
-Smells... -Sweet.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.520
我想說真實
I was gonna say real.

19:56.230 --> 19:58.190
千真萬確 謝謝
It's all very real, thanks.

19:59.530 --> 20:01.150
我已經不碰魔法了
I've put the magic behind me.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.530
看得出來
So I can see.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.780
我知道你遲早會出現
Well, I knew sooner or later you'd show up...

20:05.950 --> 20:07.950
想討論西景鎮發生的事
wanting to discuss what happened at Westview.

20:09.870 --> 20:12.750
我犯了錯 有些人受到了傷害
I made mistakes, and people were hurt...

20:12.920 --> 20:16.670
但你最後修正了一切 這點無庸置疑
But you put things right in the end, and that was never in doubt.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.720
我不是來談西景鎮的
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.880
那你來做什麼？
Then what are you here for?

20:21.050 --> 20:22.260
我們需要你幫忙
We need your help.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.310
幫什麼忙？
With what?

20:26.470 --> 20:28.470
你瞭解多重宇宙嗎？
What do you know about the Multiverse?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.270
多重宇宙
The Multiverse.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.440
幻視有他的一套理論
Vis had his theories.

20:31.600 --> 20:35.610
他認為那是真的 而且很危險
He believed it was real, and dangerous.

20:35.770 --> 20:37.270
這兩點他都說對了
Well, he was right about both.

20:37.940 --> 20:40.570
我們發現一個能在其中移動的女孩
We found a girl who can somehow travel across it...

20:40.740 --> 20:42.240
但有人在追殺她
but she's being pursued.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.950
-誰？　-某種惡魔
-Pursued by who? -Some kind of demon.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.070
覬覦她的能力
One that covets her power for itself.

20:46.740 --> 20:50.500
我們帶她去卡瑪泰姬 雖然能自衛
We've taken her to Kamar-Taj, and we've got our defenses...

20:50.660 --> 20:52.410
但我們用得上一個復仇者
but we could use an Avenger.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.290
還有其他復仇者
There are other Avengers.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.960
對 在留龐克頭的弓箭手
Yeah, but given the choice between the archer with the mohawk...

20:57.130 --> 20:59.250
幾個與昆蟲同名的打擊犯罪高手
and several bug-themed crime fighters...

20:59.420 --> 21:04.340
或是全球最強大的魔法師之間抉擇
or one of the most powerful magic-wielders on the planet...

21:04.510 --> 21:05.840
答案顯而易見
it's an easy call.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.100
到卡瑪泰姬來
Come to Kamar-Taj.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.480
你又能被印在便當盒上了
It'll get you back on the lunch box.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.610
要是你帶阿美莉卡過來呢？
What if you brought America here?

21:17.690 --> 21:18.690
來這裡？
Here?

21:19.270 --> 21:22.030
我瞭解孤單無助
Yeah. I know what it's like to be on your own...

21:22.190 --> 21:24.780
因天生的能力而遭獵殺的滋味
hunted for abilities you never wanted...

21:25.740 --> 21:27.410
我能保護她
and I can protect her.

21:33.790 --> 21:35.750
-你還沒說她的名字吧？　-沒有
-You never told me her name, did you? -No.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.750
我沒說
No, I didn't.

21:43.590 --> 21:49.300
六邊域 Hex
<旺達在失去幻視後製造出來的範圍魔法，
可以將一定區域內的人、事、物按照旺達
的意願從分子層面進行改造>

21:43.590 --> 21:45.590
六邊域不難應付
You know, the Hex was the easy part.

21:46.390 --> 21:49.300
難的是說謊
The lying, not so much.

22:16.330 --> 22:17.420
黑暗神書
The Darkhold.

22:16.330 --> 22:28.930
黑暗神書
<又名西索恩卷軸（Chthon Scrolls）
墮落成惡魔的上古邪神西索恩所著
此前置情節出自美劇「旺達幻視」>

22:17.580 --> 22:18.960
你熟悉黑暗神書？
You're familiar with the Darkhold?

22:19.130 --> 22:20.960
我知道它是死亡之書
I know it's the Book of the Damned...

22:21.130 --> 22:24.550
接觸到它的一切都會墮入邪惡
and that it corrupts everything and everyone that it touches.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.380
不知道它是否影響了你
I wonder what it's done to you.

22:26.550 --> 22:28.930
黑暗神書只讓我看到真相
The Darkhold only showed me the truth.

22:29.090 --> 22:32.720
我能再擁有曾經失去的一切
Everything I lost can be mine again.

22:32.890 --> 22:34.430
你想對阿美莉卡怎麼樣？
What do you want with America?

22:34.600 --> 22:36.480
你想如何利用多重宇宙？
What do you want with the Multiverse?

22:36.640 --> 22:38.940
我會離開這個現實
I'm going to leave this reality...

22:39.690 --> 22:42.150
到能跟孩子在一起的那個現實
and go to one where I can be with my children.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.610
旺達 你的孩子不是真的
Wanda, your children aren't real.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.820
你用魔法創造了他們
You created them using magic.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.610
每個母親都是
That's what every mother does.

22:51.410 --> 22:53.160
如果你知道…
If you knew...

22:53.740 --> 22:56.160
有一個宇宙
there was a universe...

22:56.330 --> 22:58.040
你在那裡很幸福
where you were happy...

22:58.210 --> 23:00.170
難道你不想去嗎？
wouldn't you want to go there?

23:00.630 --> 23:02.170
我現在很幸福
I am happy.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.090
我最清楚什麼叫自欺欺人
I know better than most what self-deception looks like.

23:06.470 --> 23:09.380
你公然違反所有自然定律
What you're doing is a flagrant violation of every natural law...

23:09.550 --> 23:12.430
如果奪走那孩子的能力 她必死無疑
and if you take that child's power, she won't survive.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.720
我並不樂意傷害人 史蒂芬
I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.060
但她不是孩子
But she's not a child.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.390
她是超自然個體
She's a supernatural being.

23:19.560 --> 23:23.440
那麼強大的能力足以破壞各個世界
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this and other worlds.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.030
她犧牲小我…
Her sacrifice...

23:26.030 --> 23:27.240
能完成大我
would be for the greater good.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.900
你別想被印在便當盒上了
Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye,

23:29.070 --> 23:31.700
那是我們敵人用的借口
'cause that's the kind of justification our enemies use.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.370
那是你的借口嗎…
Is it the one you used...

23:34.080 --> 23:36.450
當你給薩諾斯（滅霸）時間寶石？
when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?

23:39.920 --> 23:43.630
那是戰爭 我是不得已的
That was a war, and I did what I had to do.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.090
你破壞規則 成為英雄
You break the rules and become a hero.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.170
我卻變成敵人
I do it, and I become the enemy.

23:49.510 --> 23:51.130
好像不太公平
That doesn't seem fair.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.180
現在要怎樣？
What happens now?

23:54.350 --> 23:55.930
回到卡瑪泰姬
Return to Kamar-Taj...

23:56.100 --> 23:59.230
準備在日落前交出阿美莉卡查維茲
and prepare to hand over America Chavez by sundown.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.560
和平移交
Peacefully.

24:02.770 --> 24:03.980
然後…
After that...

24:06.020 --> 24:08.440
你再也不會見到我
You'll never see me again.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.410
不然呢？
And if we don't?

24:18.250 --> 24:20.290
來找她的就不會是旺達
Then it won't be Wanda who comes for her.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.790
而是緋紅女巫
It will be the Scarlet Witch.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.930
緋紅女巫
The Scarlet Witch.

24:38.970 --> 24:40.730
旺達不見了
Wanda's gone.

24:40.890 --> 24:43.560
她取得黑暗神書 黑暗神書控制了她
She's got the Darkhold, and the Darkhold has her.

24:47.230 --> 24:50.320
緋紅女巫擁有深不可測的魔法
The Scarlet Witch is a being of unfathomable magic.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.700
她能隨意改寫現實
She can rewrite reality as she chooses...

24:55.200 --> 24:57.660
不是將統治宇宙
and is prophesized to either rule...

24:57.830 --> 24:59.830
就是摧毀宇宙
or annihilate the cosmos.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.170
她用意志力控制了整座小鎮
She took over a whole town using her mind.

25:04.540 --> 25:07.130
如果獲得阿美莉卡的能力
If she gets America's power...

25:07.290 --> 25:09.630
她就能征服多重宇宙
she could enslave the entire Multiverse.

25:11.550 --> 25:14.380
所以你求助的對象
So, the person you went to ask for help...

25:14.550 --> 25:16.760
不但知道我在哪裡
and told exactly where I am...

25:16.930 --> 25:18.390
也想殺我？
is the person that's trying to kill me?

25:19.810 --> 25:20.850
對
Yeah.

25:21.560 --> 25:25.150
立刻暫停教學 武裝學員
Suspend teaching at once and arm the students.

25:25.310 --> 25:27.860
卡瑪泰姬必須轉為抗敵要塞
Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.

26:03.060 --> 26:04.180
哇
Wow.

26:04.350 --> 26:06.850
是香港和倫敦至聖所的大師
It's the masters of the Hong Kong and London Sanctums.

26:07.730 --> 26:11.110
能再一次跟您並肩拚死 是我的光榮
It's an honor to court death alongside you once again.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.440
是我們共同的光榮
The honor is ours.

26:12.610 --> 26:16.530
無論至尊法師如何要求，我們死而後已
Whatever the Sorcerer Supreme asks of us, it shall be done.

26:17.070 --> 26:18.700
還沒有任務的人 跟我來
Extra duty men, follow me.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.910
這是古老習俗
It's ancient custom.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.680
小心說話
Choose your words wisely.

27:25.850 --> 27:28.140
多重宇宙的命運可能因此改變
The fate of the Multiverse may depend on it.

27:28.310 --> 27:29.350
瞭解
Got it.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.060
不要有壓力
No pressure, then.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.290
全是為了一個你昨天認識的孩子
All this for a child you met yesterday.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.290
旺達 你有權利生氣
Wanda, you are justifiably angry.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.290
你不得不做出莫大的犧牲
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

27:53.460 --> 27:56.170
我在愛人的頭上炸出一個洞
I blew a hole through the head of the man I loved...

27:57.510 --> 28:00.340
結果卻毫無意義
and it meant nothing.

28:00.510 --> 28:04.470
不要跟我談犧牲 史蒂芬斯特蘭奇
Do not speak to me of sacrifice, Stephen Strange.

28:12.480 --> 28:15.520
如果你給我我要的
If you give me what I want...

28:15.690 --> 28:18.360
我就送你去能和克裡斯汀一起的世界
I'll send you to a world where you can be with Christine.

28:20.530 --> 28:24.240
強大的卡瑪泰姬會聯合對抗你
The full might of Kamar-Taj stands against you.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.160
就防守位置 準備
Defensive positions, now!

28:34.750 --> 28:36.960
休想進入這些聖地
Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.

28:37.130 --> 28:40.760
你不知道我現在有多理智
You have no idea just how reasonable I have been.

28:40.920 --> 28:41.760
對
Yeah.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.590
死亡之書 自稱女巫
Book of the Damned, calling yourself a witch,

28:43.590 --> 28:44.970
召喚怪獸綁架少女
conjuring creatures to abduct a kid...

28:45.140 --> 28:47.390
我不覺得那叫理智
I don't exactly call that being reasonable.

28:47.560 --> 28:52.390
派那些怪獸去追她而不是我自己，當然是仁慈
Sending those creatures after her instead of myself was mercy.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.480
儘管你如此虛偽 又羞辱我
And in spite of your hypocrisies, and insults...

28:56.650 --> 29:00.740
我一直求你不要從中作梗
I have begged you to safely get out of my way.

29:02.070 --> 29:04.200
你磨光了我的耐性
You have exhausted my patience...

29:05.820 --> 29:09.790
但我很希望你瞭解 即使是現在
but I do hope you understand that even now...

29:09.950 --> 29:11.500
馬上就要發生的這些事
what's about to happen...

29:12.870 --> 29:14.540
依然是我…
this is me...

29:14.710 --> 29:17.380
非常理智的行為
being reasonable.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.640
撐住
Hold!

29:30.100 --> 29:31.890
撐住
Hold!

29:46.370 --> 29:47.820
搞定
Nailed it.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.250
強化防護盾
Reinforce the shield.

29:53.410 --> 29:54.410
強化防護盾
Reinforce the shield!

29:54.580 --> 29:56.420
強化防護盾
Reinforce the shield!

30:16.600 --> 30:18.020
她想干擾他們的想法
She's trying to get in their heads.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.400
魔法師 鞏固意志
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

30:33.830 --> 30:35.540
快跑
Run.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.230
防護盾失效
The shield is down!

31:05.070 --> 31:05.900
發射
Fire!

31:09.740 --> 31:10.570
贊
Yes!

31:22.090 --> 31:23.130
找掩護
Take cover!

31:26.300 --> 31:27.930
任意發射
Fire at will!

31:40.060 --> 31:41.100
撤退
Fall back.

31:42.310 --> 31:43.320
王！
Wong!

31:43.480 --> 31:44.610
快離開
Get out of here!

31:50.490 --> 31:51.570
快走…
Go, go.

31:51.870 --> 31:52.910
快走
Go!

32:33.070 --> 32:35.780
阿美莉卡
America...

32:42.250 --> 32:45.250
想要那個女孩 先過我這一關
You want the girl, you'll have to go through me.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
好
Fine.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.200
我們得馬上帶你離開
We gotta get you out of here. Now.

33:58.660 --> 33:59.870
王 怎麼回事？
Wong, what happened?

34:00.040 --> 34:01.620
卡瑪泰姬淪陷了
Kamar-Taj has fallen.

34:15.590 --> 34:17.140
反射
Reflections.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.140
她利用反射影像 蓋起來
She's using the reflections. Cover them.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.010
你犧牲那些生命
You gave all those lives...

34:53.170 --> 34:55.880
只為了不讓我接近我的孩子
just to keep me from my children.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.470
是你殺了那些人
You took those lives.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.510
不能讓你進入多重宇宙
You cannot be allowed to cross into the Multiverse.

35:00.970 --> 35:02.720
我不是怪物 史蒂芬
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

35:03.430 --> 35:04.470
我是母親
I'm a mother.

35:04.640 --> 35:06.440
旺達 你沒有孩子
Wanda, you have no children.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.690
他們不存在
They don't exist.

35:08.850 --> 35:10.560
他們存在
Oh, but they do.

35:10.730 --> 35:12.860
在其他每個宇宙裡
In every other universe.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.280
我知道他們在
I know they do.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.780
因為我會夢到他們
Because I dream of them...

35:18.610 --> 35:21.410
每天晚上
every night.

35:27.830 --> 35:28.920
我們表演出來
We're gonna show it.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.210
媽 你看我們
Mom, watch us. Mom!

35:30.380 --> 35:33.090
跑遠一點 回去…
Go long. Got it! All right, go on back, go on back.

35:33.250 --> 35:34.460
好 不要…
All right, yeah. Don't...

35:35.210 --> 35:36.300
夢到我的寶貝兒子
Of my boys.

35:36.470 --> 35:37.550
比利 你敢！
Billy, don't you dare! No!

35:37.720 --> 35:39.510
夢到我們一起生活
Of our life together.

35:39.680 --> 35:40.800
-這裡　-贊
-Here. -Yes!

35:40.970 --> 35:42.180
然後回到前面
And then back to front.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.930
回到前面
Back to front.

35:44.520 --> 35:45.520
我能吃嗎？
Can I have some?

35:45.680 --> 35:46.680
拜託啦
Please?

35:48.100 --> 35:49.020
-你們好了嗎？　-沒關係
-Are you guys ready? -It's okay.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.150
我愛你 媽
I love you, Mom.

35:50.310 --> 35:51.440
每天晚上
Every night...

35:53.770 --> 35:55.230
相同的夢
the same dream.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.530
每天早晨
And every morning...

36:01.450 --> 36:04.620
相同的惡夢
the same nightmare.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.000
要是你找到他們呢？
What if you reach them?

36:10.870 --> 36:12.670
另一個你會如何？
What happens to the other you?

36:14.090 --> 36:16.130
他們的母親會怎樣？
What happens to their mother?

38:03.320 --> 38:04.530
你還好嗎？
You okay?

38:06.200 --> 38:07.490
你救了我
You saved me.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.790
希望如此
I hope so.

38:13.580 --> 38:14.580
你竟然沒吐
Surprised you didn't puke.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.500
這不是我第一趟怪異之旅
It's not my first weird trip, kid.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.460
所以 這是紐約 在多重…
So, this is New York in the Multi...

38:22.510 --> 38:23.510
對
Yep.

38:23.970 --> 38:25.010
來了
There it is.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.810
討厭
Crap.

38:35.140 --> 38:36.400
別鬧了
Cut it out.

38:39.190 --> 38:41.650
對 你傷痕纍纍
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

38:42.990 --> 38:44.400
再幫你修補
We'll get you fixed.

38:44.950 --> 38:46.110
好 阿美莉卡
All right, America.

38:46.910 --> 38:48.990
你得打開一個入口 馬上回去
You gotta open a portal and get us back there right now.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.160
我不會
I don't know how.

38:50.330 --> 38:51.450
你剛剛做到了
You just did it.

38:51.620 --> 38:52.540
不是故意的
Not on purpose.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.620
王單獨對抗旺達 我是他唯一的希望
Wong is back there alone with Wanda, and I'm the only hope he has.

38:55.790 --> 38:58.420
我不能控制…　-你一定可以
-I can't control my powers... -You must be able to control it somehow.

38:58.580 --> 38:59.540
就連我都可以…
Even I could...

39:02.340 --> 39:03.510
抱歉
Sorry.

39:05.550 --> 39:07.220
這個宇宙的你呢？
Well, what about this universe's version of you?

39:07.380 --> 39:09.090
或許她能控制她的能力
Maybe she could control her powers.

39:09.260 --> 39:11.100
這個宇宙沒有我
This universe doesn't have a me.

39:11.260 --> 39:12.930
-什麼？　-全都沒有
-What? -None of them do.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.060
你怎麼知道？
But how do you know that?

39:14.220 --> 39:15.770
因為我找過了
'Cause I've looked.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.350
我也從來沒做過夢
And 'cause I never dream.

39:26.450 --> 39:28.160
沒關係 小鬼
That's okay, kid.

39:28.320 --> 39:31.410
就算你帶我回去 我也無力對抗旺達
And even if you could get me back there, I have no way of fighting Wanda.

39:31.990 --> 39:32.990
維山帝之書呢？
What about The Book of Vishanti?

39:33.160 --> 39:34.160
怎麼樣？
What about it?

39:34.330 --> 39:36.620
你的分身認為它能阻止追我的東西
Other You thought it could stop whoever was after me.

39:36.790 --> 39:38.960
我的分身真厲害 但他不在這裡
Yeah, well, good for Other Me. He's not here, is he?

39:39.120 --> 39:41.920
我不知道它在哪 除非有另一個分身
I don't know where it is, so unless there's another Other Me...

39:44.170 --> 39:45.510
我們得去找…
We need to go find...

39:46.340 --> 39:48.800
我的另一個分身
Other Other Me.

40:20.670 --> 40:21.670
紅燈通行？
We go on red?

40:21.830 --> 40:24.420
記住多重宇宙旅行的第一個重點
Rule number one of Multiversal travel...

40:24.590 --> 40:26.000
你什麼都不懂
you don't know anything.

40:26.670 --> 40:27.670
對
Right.

40:31.130 --> 40:32.260
紅燈了
It's red.

40:34.050 --> 40:36.220
第二個重點是什麼？
So, what's rule number two?

40:39.520 --> 40:40.640
阿美莉卡？
America?

40:43.440 --> 40:44.520
阿美莉卡
America!

40:45.570 --> 40:46.570
第二個重點
Rule number two...

40:46.730 --> 40:48.030
找吃的
find food.

40:48.190 --> 40:50.150
最好是披薩 披薩球
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

40:51.110 --> 40:52.240
你拿什麼付錢？
How'd you pay for that?

40:52.410 --> 40:53.370
免費的
It was free.

40:53.530 --> 40:55.780
其實大多數宇宙的食物都免費
Food's free in most universes, actually.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.830
你們竟然得付錢 好怪
It's weird you guys have to pay for it.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.830
-喂 你沒付錢　-對
-Hey! You didn't pay for that. -Right.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.120
完蛋
Crap.

41:01.290 --> 41:02.500
或許這裡不能免費吃
Maybe it's not free here.

41:02.670 --> 41:04.630
披薩老爸一定收錢
Pizza Poppa always gets paid.

41:04.790 --> 41:06.750
披薩老爸 放輕鬆 她只是個孩子
All right, Pizza Poppa, relax. She's just a kid...

41:06.920 --> 41:09.170
-她餓了　-你才放輕鬆 奇異博士
-She was hungry. -Relax yourself, there, Doctor Strange.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.180
這披風哪來的？
Where'd you get this cape from, anyway?

41:12.340 --> 41:14.050
感覺很像真的
That feels authentic.

41:14.220 --> 41:15.970
這不是披風 是斗篷 建議你放開
It's not a cape, it's a cloak, and I suggest you let go.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.520
這套服裝從奇異博物館拿的吧？
You took this whole suit from the Strange Museum, didn't you?

41:19.680 --> 41:21.480
-奇異博物館？　-你個小偷
-Strange Museum? -You're a taker.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.190
哼 你為什麼不吃點芥末？
Why don't you take some mustard, huh?

41:32.740 --> 41:34.110
走吧 趁機快溜
Come on. It's not permanent.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.910
他幾分鐘後就會停止？
Like he'll stop in a few minutes?

41:37.830 --> 41:39.330
大約三星期
About three weeks.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.040
我們經過的那些宇宙…
Those universes we went through...

41:45.210 --> 41:47.380
我們是在改寫它們的歷史嗎？
were we paint in one of them?

41:47.540 --> 41:49.880
對 最好別困在裡面
Yeah, you don't wanna get stuck in there.

41:50.050 --> 41:51.590
每次都很難熬
It's really hard to eat.

41:52.840 --> 41:54.300
你到過幾個宇宙？
How many universes have you been to?

41:56.800 --> 41:57.800
72個
Seventy-two.

41:58.470 --> 41:59.810
73 加上這個
Seventy-three, counting this one.

42:01.560 --> 42:02.640
很多耶
That's a lot.

好高級的餐廳
This is pretty fancy.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.040
你得再申請一筆學貸嗎？
Did you have to take out another student loan?

42:21.200 --> 42:25.040
不用 我剛賣掉了一顆上周手術中的腎臟
Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys that we operated on last week.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.550
我要送你一樣小禮物
So got you a little something.

42:33.170 --> 42:34.930
恭喜
Congratulations.

Where's this?

43:11.380 --> 43:12.750
我家
Home.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.170
我的兩個媽媽
My moms.

43:41.990 --> 43:43.450
阿美莉卡
America!

44:02.140 --> 44:04.310
你說得對 這是浪費時間
You know, you were right. This is just a waste of time.

44:04.470 --> 44:05.520
小鬼
Hey, kid.

44:06.180 --> 44:09.140
那是你第一次打開入口吧？
That was the first time that you opened a portal, right?

44:09.310 --> 44:10.310
不重要
Doesn't matter.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.020
很重要 你失去了雙親
It does matter. You lost your parents.

44:12.190 --> 44:14.480
我沒失去她們 而是殺了她們
I didn't lose them. I killed them.

44:14.650 --> 44:16.570
不 你沒有 別這麼想
No. No, you did not. Don't even think that.

44:16.740 --> 44:19.490
我用無法控制的能力打開一個入口
Okay, I opened a portal with the powers I can't control...

44:19.660 --> 44:21.530
送她們去一個致命的宇宙
and sent them to a random, probably deadly universe...

44:21.700 --> 44:22.700
-無法逃脫　-聽著
-with no way to escape. -Listen...

44:22.870 --> 44:25.290
如果你媽媽跟女兒有一丁點像
if your moms are anything like their daughter...

44:25.450 --> 44:26.620
她們就會活著
they survived.

44:27.330 --> 44:29.580
相信你有一天會再見到她們
I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.

44:33.790 --> 44:34.840
說得真好
Not bad.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.550
謝謝
Thanks.

44:39.050 --> 44:41.010
在你記憶銀行裡的女人
That woman in your memory bank thing...

44:41.180 --> 44:42.470
是克裡斯汀吧？
that was Christine, right?

44:44.430 --> 44:45.970
對 那是克裡斯汀
Yes, that was Christine.

44:46.140 --> 44:47.930
-你怎麼認得她？　-你的分身
-How do you know her? -From Other You.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.640
他們在一起嗎？
Were they together?

44:49.810 --> 44:51.270
沒有 他們不聯絡了
No, they didn't talk anymore.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.440
他搞砸了
He blew it.

44:52.600 --> 44:53.610
當然
Of course.

44:54.730 --> 44:56.530
你跟克裡斯汀的關係也搞砸了嗎？
Did you blow it with your Christine?

44:58.030 --> 44:59.900
對 我想是
Yes, I guess I did.

45:00.070 --> 45:01.070
為什麼？
Why?

45:02.410 --> 45:03.490
說來複雜
Complicated.

45:03.660 --> 45:06.080
比在多重宇宙被女巫追殺還複雜？
More complicated than being chased by a witch through the Multiverse?

45:06.240 --> 45:08.200
對 是的
Yes, actually, it is.

45:39.610 --> 45:42.110
（奇異博士奉獻生命 擊敗薩諾斯<滅霸>）

45:42.280 --> 45:44.950
（向地球最強英雄致上永恆謝意）

45:48.790 --> 45:50.160
「奉獻生命 擊敗薩諾斯」？
"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?

45:50.330 --> 45:52.330
看吧？我們不全是壞蛋
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

45:53.580 --> 45:55.460
如果你的分身死了
If Other You's dead...

45:55.670 --> 45:57.420
那誰是至尊法師？
who's Master of the Sanctum?

46:03.430 --> 46:05.390
糟糕
Oh, shit.

46:15.190 --> 46:17.520
-你認識他？　-對 莫多
-You know him? -Yeah. Mordo.

46:17.690 --> 46:19.780
他是最早讓我進入卡瑪泰姬的人
He was actually the first guy who let me into Kamar-Taj.

46:19.940 --> 46:20.820
太好了
Oh, great.

46:20.980 --> 46:24.070
後來他性情大變 誓言追殺我
And then he snapped and dedicated his life to trying to kill me.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.610
噢
Oh.

46:25.780 --> 46:27.030
太好了
Great.

46:31.660 --> 46:33.960
我始終認為這一天會來
I always suspected this day would come.

46:34.120 --> 46:35.120
是嗎？
You did?

46:35.540 --> 46:36.540
是
Yes.

46:37.380 --> 46:41.170
因為你始終認為這一天會來
Because you always suspected this day would come.

46:49.350 --> 46:50.510
我的兄弟
My brother.

46:54.850 --> 46:55.850
好
All right.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.230
進來
Come in...

46:59.400 --> 47:03.650
跟我好好聊聊你的宇宙
and tell me everything about your universe.

47:08.990 --> 47:10.620
紅燈通行
You go on red.

47:13.290 --> 47:15.410
你也挺令人佩服的
And you're quite formidable too, it seems.

47:15.750 --> 47:18.250
多重宇宙旅人
A Multiversal traveler.

47:18.420 --> 47:21.590
感謝你帶奇異博士到安全的地方
Well, thank the stars you brought Doctor Strange to safety.

47:21.750 --> 47:24.050
逃離不代表安全
Well, just 'cause we jumped ship doesn't mean we're safe.

47:24.590 --> 47:27.680
我們的旺達有能力召喚惡魔與怪物
Our Wanda has the ability to conjure demons and monsters...

47:27.840 --> 47:30.180
在其他宇宙攻擊阿美莉卡
to attack America in other universes.

47:30.350 --> 47:31.810
她有黑暗神書？
So she has the Darkhold?

47:31.970 --> 47:33.470
你知道黑暗神書？
Oh, you know of the Darkhold?

47:33.640 --> 47:36.270
對 這個宇宙也有黑暗神書
Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold in this universe, too.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.440
我在這個至聖所守護著它
I guard it here in this Sanctum.

47:38.600 --> 47:42.520
我們絕不讓那危險武器落入敵人手中
We would never risk a weapon that dangerous falling into the wrong hands.

47:42.690 --> 47:43.690
沒錯
Damn right.

47:43.860 --> 47:47.150
如果你的黑暗神書跟我們的相似
But if your Darkhold is anything like ours, I'm afraid she can do far worse...

47:47.320 --> 47:50.870
恐怕她能做的會比召喚怪物來追你更邪惡
than just summon monsters to come after you here.

47:51.450 --> 47:52.450
什麼意思？
What do you mean?

47:52.620 --> 47:56.790
書裡有一個咒語
There is a spell contained within those pages...

47:58.330 --> 48:00.170
會侵蝕靈魂
corrosive to the soul...

48:01.790 --> 48:04.300
褻瀆現實
a desecration of reality itself.

48:06.220 --> 48:07.220
夢行
Dreamwalking.

48:09.260 --> 48:12.430
夢行中的魔法師會將自己的意識
A Dreamwalking sorcerer projects their own consciousness...

48:12.600 --> 48:15.140
從他們的宇宙投射至另一個
from their universe into another...

48:16.140 --> 48:19.060
佔有另一個自我的身體
possessing the body of an alternate self.

48:21.980 --> 48:25.110
他們可能操縱邪惡的分身
They may puppeteer this unholy doppelganger

48:25.110 --> 48:27.280
從遠方追殺敵人
and pursue their enemies from afar.

48:30.700 --> 48:34.910
這種佔有並非現實之間的永久連結
The possession is not a permanent link between realities.

48:35.080 --> 48:37.660
他們在短短的夢行時間裡
But in the fleeting time they Dreamwalk...

48:37.830 --> 48:41.710
能對入侵的宇宙造成無法挽回的傷害
they can do irreparable damage to the universe they invade.

48:44.500 --> 48:47.420
所以你面對的或許不是惡魔
So it may not be a demon that you face.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.470
可能是緋紅女巫
It may be the Scarlet Witch.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.060
她為何不一開始就用這招？
Why didn't she do that to begin with?

48:56.220 --> 48:58.480
當時她還能講理
Because that was her being reasonable.

48:59.730 --> 49:01.270
你對維山帝之書瞭解多少？
What do you know of The Book of Vishanti?

49:01.440 --> 49:02.980
黑暗神書的剋星？
The Darkhold's antithesis?

49:04.110 --> 49:08.440
它能給魔法師制敵所需的力量
It can give a sorcerer whatever power they need to vanquish their enemy.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.780
我需要你幫我找到它
I need your help to get me to it.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.620
抱歉 史蒂芬
I'm sorry, Stephen.

49:19.160 --> 49:22.880
但我特別希望你和其他人都瞭解
But I hope you, of all people, understand...

We like ice cream

就跟每個小朋友一樣
Like every child should

52:46.790 --> 52:50.370
如果吃了冰淇淋
And if we get some ice cream

52:50.540 --> 52:56.090
我們保證會聽話
We promise to be good

53:23.870 --> 53:24.870
你沒死
You're alive.

53:25.580 --> 53:26.580
對
Yes.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.120
可是很多人死了
But so many others were lost.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.420
放了我
Set me free.

53:32.580 --> 53:34.080
我必須摧毀那本書
I need to destroy the book.

53:34.250 --> 53:37.050

我需要黑暗神書的咒語

54:54.670 --> 54:55.870
把你知道的告訴我

54:57.670 --> 54:59.460
那你得殺了我 女巫

55:02.760 --> 55:04.010
殺他們
Them.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.310

55:14.020 --> 55:15.310
旺達 求求你
Wanda, please!

55:20.320 --> 55:22.360
那本黑暗神書是復本
The Darkhold was a copy!

55:25.110 --> 55:26.320
復本？
A copy?

55:26.490 --> 55:27.780
傳說有一座山
Legend speaks of a mountain...

55:27.950 --> 55:30.620
你要找的黑魔法咒語刻在山壁上
with the wretched spells you seek carved into its walls.

55:31.950 --> 55:34.620
黑暗神書抄寫在那裡
It's there the Darkhold was transcribed.

55:35.580 --> 55:36.830
萬達格山
Mount Wundagore.

55:37.830 --> 55:39.170
萬達格？
Wundagore?

55:39.920 --> 55:41.800
沒人成功抵達過
No one has survived the journey.

55:46.180 --> 55:48.890
也許我們會是例外
Perhaps we will be the exception.

55:56.230 --> 55:57.600
喂！
Hey!

55:58.400 --> 55:59.650
喂！
Hey!

56:12.200 --> 56:13.990

56:32.220 --> 56:33.470
喂 白袍哥
Hey, lab coat.

56:34.220 --> 56:35.310
這是什麼地方？
Where the hell are we?

56:36.730 --> 56:39.690
我不知道你是誰 你想幹什麼
Look, I don't know who you are, or what you think you're trying to do here...

56:39.850 --> 56:41.900
-但這種情況…　-謝謝
-but these situations don't usually... -Thank you.

56:42.060 --> 56:44.650
對沒本事的科學家通常不太友好
...work out well for the nameless scientists, so just...

56:49.150 --> 56:50.450
克裡斯汀？
Christine?

56:52.280 --> 56:53.370
你好 史蒂芬
Hello, Stephen.

56:55.910 --> 56:57.040
查維茲小姐
Miss Chavez.

56:58.710 --> 57:00.000
回答你的問題
To answer your question...

57:00.170 --> 57:02.630
這是一個高度戒備的研究機構
you are in a highly secure research facility.

57:02.790 --> 57:04.920
你們倆 加上你有知覺的斗篷
The two of you, along with your sentient cloak...

57:05.090 --> 57:07.050
是來接受監視與檢驗的
are here for surveillance and testing.

57:08.130 --> 57:09.260
檢驗？
Testing?

57:09.420 --> 57:11.930
對 你們是來自另一個宇宙的訪客
Well, yes. You're visitors from another universe.

57:12.090 --> 57:15.640
你們的磁場可能有輻射的
Your magnetic signatures could be radioactive...

57:15.810 --> 57:18.430
你們可能有我們無法治療的疾病
you may be carrying diseases we just don't have treatments for.

57:19.230 --> 57:22.150
因此才用這些漂亮的聚碳酸酯魚缸
Hence, these amazing polycarbonate fish bowls.

57:23.610 --> 57:26.230
所以我該謝謝你囉？
I assume I have you to thank for these then?

57:26.730 --> 57:29.990
是 我用尼山迪之沙研發出來的
Yes. I developed those using the Sands of Nisanti.

57:30.150 --> 57:32.450
838史蒂芬的魔法遺跡之一
One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.

57:32.610 --> 57:33.570
838史蒂芬？
838 Stephen?

57:33.740 --> 57:35.330
那是我的機器人版還是…
Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...

57:35.490 --> 57:37.240
我們宇宙是838
Our universe is 838,

57:37.240 --> 57:39.790
你們宇宙的編號是616
and we've designated yours 616.

57:40.620 --> 57:42.790
你們一定非常瞭解多重宇宙
You guys sure must know a lot about the Multiverse...

57:42.960 --> 57:45.130
竟有人負責幫各個現實命名
if you got someone going around naming realities.

57:45.290 --> 57:46.300
對
Yes.

57:47.050 --> 57:48.300
就是我
Me.

57:48.460 --> 57:50.380
我是巴克斯特基金會資深研究員
I'm a senior fellow with the Baxter Foundation...

57:50.550 --> 57:52.590
專長是多重宇宙研究
and I specialize in Multiversal research.

57:54.890 --> 57:56.930
你怎麼會來這裡工作？
So, how'd you end up working here?

57:57.100 --> 57:59.060
不管這是哪裡
Wherever here is.

57:59.220 --> 58:00.560
我自願加入
Well, I volunteered.

58:01.140 --> 58:02.520
在你的葬禮上
At your funeral.

58:03.730 --> 58:05.060
謝謝你去參加
Thank you for going.

58:05.560 --> 58:08.780
你們的傷都很像 但不完全一樣
Your injuries, they're similar, but they're not identical.

58:08.940 --> 58:10.190
很有意思
It's fascinating.

58:10.900 --> 58:12.450
（98.6%相符）

58:15.950 --> 58:20.290
我們在這個宇宙是什麼關係？
What were we to each other in this universe?

58:23.960 --> 58:25.960
我們一直沒搞清楚
We never quite figured that out.

58:26.250 --> 58:27.380
是嗎？
Yeah?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.090
這算是我們的共同點
Well, that's something we got in common.

58:33.880 --> 58:37.140
克裡斯汀 你得讓我們出去
Christine, you gotta let us out of here.

58:37.890 --> 58:39.600
現在人人深陷危機
Everyone's in real danger.

58:39.770 --> 58:41.810
我知道你不瞭解我
Look, I know you don't know me...

58:41.980 --> 58:42.940
我也不想
And I don't want to.

58:43.480 --> 58:47.270
在你的宇宙裡我是你的誰都不要緊
Whatever I was to you in your universe does not matter.

58:48.520 --> 58:49.610
為什麼？
Why not?

58:54.610 --> 58:56.320
因為你很危險 史蒂芬
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

58:58.120 --> 59:00.620
我的宇宙有人要抓那個女孩
Someone from my universe wants that girl...

59:00.790 --> 59:03.500
對方會徹底摧毀這個地方
and she's gonna rip this place apart atom-by-atom...

59:03.660 --> 59:05.080
不達目的絕不罷休
until she gets what she wants.

59:05.250 --> 59:08.710
我不管你們來自復仇者聯盟或神盾局
So I don't care if you're from the Avengers or S.H.I.E.L.D...

59:08.880 --> 59:09.880
都不是
We're neither.

59:15.800 --> 59:17.010
那是什麼？
Well, what then?

59:17.180 --> 59:18.180
九頭蛇？
HYDRA?

59:18.350 --> 59:22.430
光照會現在要見你
The Illuminati will see you now.

59:22.600 --> 59:23.810
光照什麼會？
The Illumi-what-y?

59:31.860 --> 59:33.530
別讓人傷害那個小鬼
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

59:37.820 --> 59:39.240
不會有事的
It's gonna be okay.

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:11.360
你不能直接帶我們上去嗎？
You couldn't portal us up there?

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.940
我的魔法只能帶我們到這裡
My magic can only take us so far.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.610
秘術師不該踏上…
Masters of the Mystic Arts weren't meant to tread...

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.160
萬達格山禁地
upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore.

01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:50.100
很久以前 第一個惡魔西索恩
Eons ago, the first demon, Chthon, carved his dark magic...

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:52.690
將他的黑暗魔法刻在這座陵墓上
into this tomb.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:57.610
同樣的咒語後來抄入黑暗神書
These same spells were later transcribed into the Darkhold.

01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:16.550
外人無法得知裡面有什麼無情怪物
There's no telling what soulless monstrosities lie within.

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.970
它們一直在等我
They've been waiting for me.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.020
這不是陵墓
This isn't a tomb.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:16.770
而是王座
It's a throne.

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:53.520
史蒂芬斯特蘭奇
Stephen Strange...

01:02:54.190 --> 01:02:56.810
你被召喚到光照會面前

神奇四俠
"Fantastic Four."

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.100
你們的歌有上排行榜嗎？
Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.310
抱歉 你覺得這是在搞笑嗎？
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.730
有人頭上有叉子
Well, there's a guy over there with a fork on his head...

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.270
對 有一點
so, yeah, a little bit.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:44.280
你得感激黑蝠王沒在談話時插嘴
Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't engage you in conversation.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.110
為什麼？他有口臭嗎？
Why? Does he have bad breath?

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.320
這個斯特蘭奇比我們的更囂張
This Strange is even more arrogant than ours.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.530
不 只是更有活力
No, just more alive.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.830
那是現在
For now.

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:57.290
史蒂芬 你來造成現實混亂與失穩
Stephen, your arrival here confuses and destabilizes reality.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.960
你留下的衝擊越大
The larger the footprint you leave behind,

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.500
對撞事件的風險就越大
the greater the risk of an Incursion.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:02.670
對撞事件？
Incursion?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:07.010
對撞事件就是兩個宇宙的界線侵蝕
An Incursion occurs when the boundary between two universes erodes...

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.390
兩者相撞
and they collide...

徹底摧毀其中之一或同歸於盡

Your alternate self created the Illuminati...

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:19.230
要做其他人無法做的困難決定
to make difficult decisions that no one else could.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.110
今天我們要決定如何處置你和那孩子
Today, we're here to determine what to do with you and the child.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.900
在我們投票前
So, before we vote...

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.780
如果有認真的話想說 就趁現在
if you got anything serious to say, now's the time.

01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:30.240
有
Yeah, I do.

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:31.700
如果你們擔心對撞事件
If it's Incursions you're worried about...

01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:34.490
你們真以為我的威脅比緋紅女巫大？
do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat than the Scarlet Witch?

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.710
如果小女巫決定夢行 我們能對付她
Oh, we can handle your little witch if she decides to Dreamwalk.

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:41.170
你們沒辦法 除非給我維山帝之書
No. No, you cannot. Not unless you give me The Book of Vishanti.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.170
多謝關心 史蒂芬
We appreciate your concern, Stephen,

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:45.050
但我們擔心的不是緋紅女巫
but it's not the Scarlet Witch that we fear.

01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:48.930
根據經驗 多重宇宙最大的危險是…
From our experience, the greatest danger to the Multiverse, it turns out...

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:50.720
奇異博士
is Doctor Strange.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.560
等等 你們的奇異博士？
Wait. Your Doctor Strange?

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.350
擊敗薩諾斯而死的地球最強英雄？
Earth's mightiest hero who died defeating Thanos?

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.230
我們應該告訴他真相
We should tell him the truth.

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.530
我們最後一位成員
Our final member...

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.610
查爾斯澤維爾教授
Professor Charles Xavier.

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:13.490
什麼真相？
What truth?

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.250
我們的斯特蘭奇不是那麼死的
That's not how our Strange died.

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:36.010
你在想現在會發生什麼
You're wondering what happens now.

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:38.060
不是
No.

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.850
我已經接受了
That I've already accepted.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.730
我真正想知道的是
But I do wonder...

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:46.780
你能逼阿美莉卡送你去任何宇宙
when you could force America to send you to any universe you want...

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.690
為何還要把她的能力佔有己有？
why take her power for your own?

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.610
你明知那樣會害死她
You know it would kill her.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.610
為了保護比利和湯米
For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.160
要是他們生病呢？
What if they get sick?

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:59.370
在無限的多重宇宙 每種病都有解藥
In the infinite Multiverse, there's a cure for every illness.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:04.000
每個問題都有解決辦法
A solution to every problem.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.260
我不願再失去他們
I won't lose them again.

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.510
就算盡你所能 旺達 你也控制不了一切
Try as you might, Wanda, you cannot control everything.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.220
我可以
But I can.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:15.010
看看你四周
Look around you.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.890
它就刻在石頭上
It's carved in stone.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.310
我原本就該統治一切
I was meant to rule everything.

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:29.030
但那不是我要的
But that's not what I want.

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:30.860
我只要我的寶貝兒子
I just want my boys.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.070
犧牲掉一個孩子的命？
At the cost of a child's life?

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.200
雖然你不能和摯愛歡聚，但在其他的世界裡卻有圓滿
Is there no peace in knowing that even though you can't be with the ones you love...

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.580
這無法讓你感到一絲安寧嗎
there are worlds where you are together?

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:41.750
還不夠嗎？
Is that not enough?

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.790
不夠
No.

01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:24.080
我們的斯特蘭奇並未因擊敗薩諾斯而死
Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos.

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:26.420
當時我們正處於戰爭
We were at war.

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:30.300
其他人團結起來阻止薩諾斯
While the rest of us banded together to try to stop Thanos...

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:34.420
史蒂芬卻一如往常選擇單獨行動
Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone.

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:36.300
他求助於黑暗神書
He turned to the Darkhold...

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:38.050
開始夢行
began Dreamwalking...

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.760
希望答案就在多重宇宙裡
in hopes that our salvation might lie in the Multiverse.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.350
結果你猜怎麼樣？
And guess what?

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.100
並沒有找到答案 但他仍一意孤行
It didn't. But he kept doing it anyway.

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.190
一天晚上你召集我們
One night, you called us all together...

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.400
坦承你一直在夢行
confessed that you had been Dreamwalking...

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:52.860
你說的是「情況已經失控」
and in your words, "Things had gotten out of hand."

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:55.240
你從未告訴我們詳細經過
You never told us the details of what had happened...

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.570
只告訴我們你不慎引了發對撞事件
only that you had inadvertently triggered an Incursion.

01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:04.450
朋友 你造成另一個宇宙毀滅
You, our friend, had caused the annihilation of another universe.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:07.250
那個現實中的每個人都死了
Everyone in that reality died.

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:08.420
每一個人
Everyone.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.750
史蒂芬否認黑暗神書的邪惡
Stephen renounced the Darkhold's evil...

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.050
但幫助我們找到維山帝之書
and helped us find The Book of Vishanti...

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:17.340
我們共同把它當武器 擊敗薩諾斯
a weapon we did use together to defeat Thanos.

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.680
但還剩一個最終的威脅
But one final threat remained.

01:08:47.710 --> 01:08:50.130
我會懷念你的 朋友
I shall miss you, my friend.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.380
我準備好了
I'm ready.

01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:05.680
對不起
I'm sorry.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.960
你們告訴克裡斯汀了嗎？
Did you tell Christine?

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:31.290
有
Yes.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880
那尊雕像…
The statue...

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:39.510
那尊雕像呢？
What about the statue?

01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:43.760
你們立了一尊雕像
You built a statue.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.560
世界需要英雄
The world needs heroes.

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:47.430
我們做出困難的決定
We made the difficult choice

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:49.480
因為我們知道斯特蘭奇的能耐
because we knew what our Strange was capable of.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:55.230
或許是每個奇異博士的能耐
What, perhaps, every Doctor Strange is capable of.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.360
大樓遭人闖入
The building's been breached.

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.990
不會吧 真天才
No shit, genius.

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.580
顯示安全狀態
Status report on sentries.

01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:08.000
停在…
Stop where you...

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.540
回來
Get back!

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:17.050
停在原地
Stop where you are...

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:18.420
她要去找那孩子
She's heading for the child.

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:20.380
看好他 我們回來再投票
Watch him. We'll vote on our return.

01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:24.930
史蒂芬 要是你逃離這房間
Stephen, should you manage to escape this chamber...

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.100
一定要引導阿美莉卡查維茲
you must guide America Chavez.

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:28.600
你在說什麼東西？
What the hell are you saying?

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:31.060
救那個女孩 去找維山帝之書
Save the girl and get to The Book of Vishanti.

01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:32.600
那本書在這裡？
What? You have the book here?

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:35.020
對 你建立了一個中繼點
Yes. You built a waypoint.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:37.360
查爾斯 我們不能相信他
Charles, we cannot trust him.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.480
我想可以
I believe we can.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.700
有人一時迷途
Just because someone stumbles and loses their way...

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.700
不代表他們會永遠迷失
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:49.160
我們看看你是哪種奇異博士
We will see what kind of Doctor Strange you are.

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.100
謝謝
Thank you.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.700
（安全漏洞 啟動封鎖程序）

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:53.500
外力入侵
Perimeter breakdown.

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.670
全體衛兵出動
All sentries engage.

01:10:58.300 --> 01:10:59.130
所有人都出去
Everybody out.

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:00.960
-入侵者接近　-快點
-Intruder approaching. -Now!

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.380
是旺達
It's Wanda.

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:10.180
（D24室 封控程序 越級控制）

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.900
奧創命令你停止
Ultron commands you to halt.

01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:24.070
奧創命令你…
Ultron commands...

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.740
（壓力密封解除）

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.740
快點…她來了
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.460
糟了
Oh, no.

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.190
旺達 住手
Wanda, stop.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:59.440
你掌控了一個無辜女人
You've possessed an innocent woman,

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:00.820
但還是能懸崖勒馬
but you can still do the right thing.

01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:02.900
放了她
Let her go.

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:07.070
求求你
Please.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.780
我自己有小孩 能體會你的痛苦
I have children of my own. I understand your pain.

01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:13.290
他們的母親還活著嗎？
Is their mother still alive?

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:15.500
是
Yes.

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.670
很好
Good.

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:19.880
會有人留下來撫養他們
There will be someone left to raise them.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:26.510
旺達 黑蝠王嘴巴張開就能摧毀你
Wanda, Black Bolt could destroy you with one whisper from his mouth.

01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:29.430
什麼嘴巴？
What mouth?

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.650
帶我去找維山帝之書
Take me to The Book of Vishanti,

01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.610
我們一起對抗她
so that we can fight her together.

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.740
你沒資格發號施令
You are in no position to give orders.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.080
等他們回來 我這一票將終結程序
My vote will conclude these proceedings when they return.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:50.680
你還沒受夠嗎？
Haven't you had enough?

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.260
我可以陪你玩一整天
Oh, I could do this all day.

01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:32.260
滾出我的宇宙
Get the hell out of my universe!

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:07.840
他們不會回來了
They're not coming back.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.220
你剛剛表明要殺死你朋友
And you just cast your vote now to kill your friends.

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:16.720
那以前也沒為你帶來困擾
Not that that ever bothered you before.

01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:22.060
在我的宇宙 你恨我
You know, you hated me where I came from.

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:25.150
我敢說你在這裡也偷偷恨我 兄弟
And I bet secretly, my brother, you hated me here.

01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:27.270
你一定嫉妒死了
You must've been so jealous.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:28.690
知道嗎？
Do you know what?

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:30.900
聽到我如此墮落 你一定樂壞了
I bet you were thrilled when you heard I'd been corrupted.

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.900
你大概一開始就給了我黑暗神書
Hell, you probably gave me the Darkhold to begin with...

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.820
你完全不瞭解這個宇宙
You know nothing of this universe!

01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:38.620
你殺死史蒂芬斯特蘭奇才能掌控至聖所
I know that killing Stephen Strange was your ticket to getting the Sanctum...

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:40.240
成為至尊魔法師
to becoming Sorcerer Supreme...

01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:43.080
加入你那個小丑馬戲團 光照會
and to joining your little circus of clowns, the Illuminati.

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:44.710
我準備好…
I'm ready...

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:50.670
投下我這一票了
to cast my vote now.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.700
我想我開始懂了
I think I'm beginning to understand...

01:16:58.110 --> 01:17:01.830
你的莫多為何不太喜歡你
why your Mordo didn't like you very much!

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.250
你被封死了
You're sealed shut!

01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:16.840
後退
Okay. Get back.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:29.100
哇
Whoa.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.150
哇
Whoa.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.860
夠了
Enough!

01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:32.960
拜託救救我
Help me. Please.

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:36.960
旺達麥西莫夫 你的意志被分身挾持
Wanda Maximoff, your mind is being held hostage by your alternate self.

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:41.760
抓住我的手
Grab my hand.

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:45.010
或許 如果我把你從瓦礫中拉出來
Perhaps, if I can pull you from under the rubble...

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:46.680
咒語就會破除
the spell will break.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.480
你們還好嗎？
Hey! You all right?

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:37.940
沒事吧？
You okay?

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400
嗨
Hey.

01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.700
-還好嗎？　-還好
-You all right? -Yeah.

01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:46.450
嗨
Hey.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.410
她修補好它了
She fixed him.

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:50.740
-謝謝　-別客氣
-Thank you. -Yeah.

01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:52.870
澤維爾說我建了維山帝之書的中繼點
Xavier said I built a waypoint to The Book of Vishanti.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:53.910
你能帶我們去嗎？
Can you take us there?

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.080
我怎麼能相信你？
How am I supposed to trust you?

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:57.290
我知道發生了什麼 很遺憾他那麼做
I know what happened, and I'm sorry for what he did...

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.550
相信我 維山帝之書是唯一的辦法
but believe me, The Book of Vishanti is the only way.

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:00.710
對 你的辦法
Yeah. Your way.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.050
你口氣很像我的史蒂芬
You sound a lot like my Stephen right now.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:06.930
他非掌控大局不可 結果害死一萬億人
He had to be the one holding the knife, and then that knife killed a trillion people.

01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:08.760
這個史蒂芬不一樣
This Stephen is different.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.600
真的
He is.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.560
其他的史蒂芬都不重要
It doesn't matter about all the other Stephens.

01:20:13.930 --> 01:20:15.310
你跟他們不同
You're not like them.

01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:20.400
聰明的小鬼
Smart kid.

01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:25.950
手伸出來
Give me your hand.

01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:32.410
別讓我後悔
Do not make me regret this.

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:33.660
不會的
I won't.

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.920
-可以走了嗎？　-跟我來
-Okay, can we go now? -Yeah, follow me.

01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:52.470
這條隧道通往哪裡？
Where's that tunnel go?

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.180
河底
Under the river.

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:03.360
快走…
Go, go, go!

01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:50.530
（警告 防爆門）

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.840
她去哪裡了？
Where did she go?

01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:22.020
我警告過你
I warned you.

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.320
旺達分身 如果你在裡面
Other Wanda, if you're in there...

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.530
憋住氣
hold your breath.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.200
-她死了嗎？　-沒有 爭取時間而已
-Did you kill her? -No, just bought us some time.

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:41.540
維山帝之書在裡面
The Book's through here.

01:22:41.710 --> 01:22:42.960
只有史蒂芬打開過
But only Stephen's ever opened it.

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.510
可惡
Shit.

01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:57.970
專屬我的魔法 只有我知道
An enchantment that's specific to me, something only I would know.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.890
-等等 史蒂芬　-快想
-Wait. Stephen. -Come on.

01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:02.640
快點
Come on.

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:04.310
史蒂芬
Stephen.

01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:13.700
對
Yeah.

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:17.660
謝謝
Thank you.

01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:19.750
不客氣
Sure.

01:23:25.210 --> 01:23:26.540
芝麻開門
Open sesame.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.240
下來 小鬼
Come on, kid.

01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:02.080
你可以
You got this.

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.120
我們可以
We got this.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.590
對
Yeah.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.640
沒事吧？
You all right?

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.930
沒事
Yeah.

01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:24.520
這是裂隙接點 宇宙之間的空間
This is the Gap Junction, the space between universes.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.200
好 維山帝之書
All right, Book.

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:43.870
給我我需要的
Give me what I need.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:03.430
-不　-不
-No! -No!

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.150
我的兒子
My boys.

01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:11.380
這不是你孩子要的
This isn't what your children would want.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.930
他們永遠不會知道
They'll never know.

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.190
或許不會
Maybe not.

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:31.770
但你會
But you will.

01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:36.980
不會吧
Oh, no.

01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:38.490
慘了
Oh, crap.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.870
這個現實好像自己瓦解
It's like this reality collapsed in on itself.

01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:44.120
對
Yeah.

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:46.330
或兩個現實相撞
Or two realities collided.

01:26:47.450 --> 01:26:48.620
快走
Come on.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.790
阿美莉卡時間不多了
America doesn't have long.

01:26:51.210 --> 01:26:52.500
那我們要去哪？
So where are we going?

01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:55.960
如果這宇宙還有一個至聖所
Well, if there's still a sanctum in this universe...

01:26:57.090 --> 01:27:00.630
那可能有另一個我的分身的分身
then there might be another Other Other Me...

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.300
那是我們救她回來的最佳機會
and that's our best shot of getting back to her.

01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:19.110
我明白你們為何這麼擔心對撞事件
Well, I can see why you guys were so worried about Incursions.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.650
不管發生過什麼事
Whatever happened...

01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:27.200
這個宇宙的你並未盡力阻止它
this universe's you didn't do a very good job of stopping it.

01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:39.510
我會告訴他你這麼說
I'll tell him you said that.

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:41.070
有人嗎？
Hello?

01:28:48.910 --> 01:28:50.160
站住別動
Stop where you are.

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:54.580
你怎麼來的？
How did you get here?

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:56.670
歪打正著
By accident.

01:28:58.670 --> 01:28:59.670
你是誰？
Who are you?

01:29:00.670 --> 01:29:01.670
你是什麼？
What are you?

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.920
我是我們之一
I'm just one of us.

01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:05.590
來自多重宇宙？
From the Multiverse?

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:06.970
沒錯
That's right.

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:09.760
提出證明
Prove it.

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.520
我們有個妹妹
We had a sister.

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.060
唐娜
Donna.

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:19.940
可是她…
But she...

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:23.480
小時候就死了
She died when we were kids.

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:26.650
怎麼死的？
How?

01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:33.830
我們在結冰的湖上玩耍
We were playing on a frozen lake and...

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.830
她掉進湖裡
she fell through the ice.

01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:48.010
我沒辦法救她
I couldn't save her.

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.890
聽起來沒錯
Sounds about right.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.020
但我們不談那件事 對吧？
But we don't talk about that, do we?

01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:59.520
對 不談
No, we don't.

01:30:01.150 --> 01:30:03.770
我想你的現實並非一直如此
Suppose your reality wasn't always like this.

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.400
我猜本來跟你的一樣 直到…
I suspect it was somewhat like yours until...

01:30:06.570 --> 01:30:07.570
直到？
Until?

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:10.950
直到我迷失
Until I lost.

01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:13.990
因為誰？
To whom?

01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:18.870
你想怎麼樣？
What do you want?

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.130
我想回家
I just want to get home.

01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:23.840
相信我
Yeah? Believe me...

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.920
長久以來我一直想離開這裡
I've been trying to leave this place for a long time.

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:29.420
黑暗神書
Darkhold.

01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:32.340
你在這個宇宙裡守護黑暗神書？
You guard the Darkhold in this universe?

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:33.550
對
Yeah.

01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:35.220
有充分的理由
For good reason.

01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:36.390
這是個開始
That's a start.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.600
我能利用它 幫我跟我的宇宙溝通
I could use it. It could help me to communicate with my universe.

01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:40.940
小心
Careful.

01:30:41.850 --> 01:30:44.360
黑暗神書會造成嚴重傷亡
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.440
不是我冷血
I don't mean to be callous...

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:50.490
還能有多嚴重的傷亡呢？
but how much of a heavier toll is there left to exact?

01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:52.820
不只是對它的現實
Not just on its reality.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.450
還有對它的讀者
On its reader.

01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:57.410
很遺憾你救不了你的宇宙
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't save your universe...

01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:00.120
或許你能幫忙救我的
but maybe you could help to save mine.

01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:05.090
你幸福嗎 史蒂芬？
Are you happy, Stephen?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.090
什麼？
What?

01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:12.340
你幸福嗎 史蒂芬？
Are you happy, Stephen?

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:16.600
這個問題是…
It's the question that...

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.770
克裡斯汀帕爾默
Christine Palmer...

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.230
在她婚禮上問我的
asked me at her wedding.

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.730
我說我當然很幸福
I said, "Yes, of course I'm happy.

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:30.190
我是力量強大的魔法師
"I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.

01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:32.990
怎麼會不幸福？
What man wouldn't be happy?"

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:38.910
然後我回到這間該死的鬼屋
And then I came back to this goddamn haunted house...

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.500
坐下來
sat down...

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.370
想著我為何說謊
and wondered why I'd lied.

01:31:46.670 --> 01:31:49.420
我根本無意讓這一切發生
I never meant for any of this to happen.

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:54.260
我在尋找一個不同的世界
I was looking for a world where things were different.

01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:59.930
在那裡我有克裡斯汀 我很幸福
Where I had Christine, where I was happy.

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.520
但我沒找到
But I didn't find it.

01:32:05.150 --> 01:32:07.310
只發現更多的我們
All I found were more of us.

01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:11.650
於是我幫那些史蒂芬一個忙
So I did those Stephens a favor.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.910
你是否做過那個墜落的夢
You ever had that dream where you're falling...

01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:19.790
彷彿你被推下高樓？
as if you've been pushed off a tall building?

01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:24.620
那應該是我
That was probably me.

01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:35.720
黑暗神書會造成嚴重傷亡
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.340
好
Okay.

01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:40.850
這樣更有理由別用它 交給我
All the more reason to give it a rest and let me have it.

01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:42.430
不如這樣吧
Here's the deal.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:47.400
我讓你用黑暗神書 你給我克裡斯汀
I'll let you use the Darkhold if you give me your Christine.

01:32:48.150 --> 01:32:49.440
唉
Yeah.

01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:51.610
我想她不會同意
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.780
是嗎？
No?

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:55.240
我也覺得不會
Didn't think so.

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.490
等著 我們來了
Hang on, we're coming.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.910
你要怎麼用黑暗神書？
What are you doing with the Darkhold?

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.960
你要夢行嗎？
Are you going to Dreamwalk?

01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.380
比夢行再多一點
It's a little bit more than just Dreamwalking.

01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:41.840
你們斯特蘭奇都一樣
All you Stranges, you're the same.

01:36:42.010 --> 01:36:43.050
我知道
I know.

01:36:45.130 --> 01:36:46.220
你說得對
You're right.

01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:48.390
我們都一樣
We are all the same.

01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:50.850
但現在那孩子需要我
But right now, that kid needs me.

01:36:51.010 --> 01:36:54.690
沒有你幫忙我絕對做不到
And I can't do any of this without your help.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:58.110
我在夢行時 請你保護我的身體
While I'm under, I need you to protect my body...

01:36:58.270 --> 01:37:00.270
以免他們因為我擅闖而攻擊我
in case they attack me for trespassing.

01:37:00.610 --> 01:37:01.780
他們是誰？
Who's "they"?

01:37:03.490 --> 01:37:05.740
地獄亡者的靈魂
The souls of the damned.

01:37:27.970 --> 01:37:28.970
好
Okay.

01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:33.140
不是有一個你必須住在那個宇宙
But doesn't a version of you need to live in that universe...

01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:35.100
你才能夢行進去嗎？
so that you can Dreamwalk into them?

01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:38.600
誰說他們必須是活的？
Who said they had to be living?

01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:54.220
史蒂芬斯特蘭奇
Stephen Strange...

01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:57.100
佔有亡者遺體是禁忌
possessing a dead body is forbidden.

01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:58.890
禁忌
Forbidden.

01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.480
擅闖者
Trespasser!

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.100
擅闖者
Trespasser!

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.730
停止夢行 否則就面對永恆的後果
Cease your Dreamwalk, or face the eternal consequences.

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:17.790
史蒂芬
Stephen!

01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:20.290
他們要把我拉下去
They're pulling me down.

01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:23.000
史蒂芬
Stephen!

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:32.220
撐下去…
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:39:33.010 --> 01:39:34.010
你在哪裡？
Where are you?

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:02.620
波歌利亞火盆
The Brazier of Bom'Galiath.

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:03.620
波歌利亞火盆-The Brazier of Bom'Galiath
<放大各種反應程度的法器，
包括物理反應、化學反應、魔法反應>

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.340
滾回地獄去吧
Go back to hell.

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.070
史蒂芬
Stephen.

01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:30.860
我在這裡
I've got you.

01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:34.450
你是秘術大師
You're a Master of the Mystic Arts.

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.370
他們是幽魂
They're spirits.

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:37.450
利用他們
Use them.

01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:43.790
利用他們
Use them.

01:40:46.210 --> 01:40:47.210
利用他們
Use them.

01:41:03.890 --> 01:41:05.190
不！
No!

01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:00.030
來啊
Come on!

01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:36.320
斯特蘭奇
Strange!

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.500
竟然夢行 你這個偽君子
Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!

01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:56.130
這次想要殺了我
This time, it's gonna take more than killing me...

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:57.550
不能只殺了這個
to kill me.

01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:08.430
殺人兇手…
Murderer! Murderer!

01:43:21.150 --> 01:43:22.910
我什麼都不想知道
I don't even wanna know.

01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:38.260
不！
No!

01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:39.420
-不　-不
-No! -No!

01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:41.380
她掙脫了
She's breaking free!

01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:42.890
困住她
Hold her!

01:43:43.050 --> 01:43:45.470
斯特蘭奇 利用阿美莉卡的力量
Strange, take America's power!

01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:53.020
沒別的辦法了
There's no other way.

01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:54.980
對
Yeah.

01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:56.770
這是唯一的辦法
This is the only way.

01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:12.500
是我 在我分身的身體裡
It's me in Other Me's body.

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:19.250
你是來奪走我的能力吧？
You're here to take my power, aren't you?

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:21.760
搶在旺達之前
Before Wanda can.

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.800
沒關係
It's okay.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.140
我現在懂了
I understand now.

01:44:31.930 --> 01:44:34.140
不 阿美莉卡
No, America.

01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:37.310
我是來告訴你要相信自己
I've come here to tell you to trust yourself.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.070
相信你的能力
Trust your power.

01:44:39.230 --> 01:44:41.240
我們就要這樣阻止她
That's how we stop her.

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.400
我無法控制它
I can't control it. I...

01:44:43.570 --> 01:44:45.570
可以 你可以
Yes, you can.

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.200
你始終都可以
You have been all along.

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.290
每次你打開入口
Every time you opened a portal,

01:44:50.290 --> 01:44:52.660
就送我們到該去的地點
you sent us exactly where we needed to go.

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.120
那第一次怎麼說？
What about the first time?

01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:58.790
那也帶領你到現在這一刻
Even that led you to this moment...

01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:03.420
你即將痛宰那個女巫
when you're gonna kick that witch's ass.

01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:27.070
我幫你
I've got you.

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.540
我擊敗不了你
I can't beat you.

01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:22.090
那就給你想要的
So I'll give you what you want.

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:38.480
比利 湯米
Billy. Tommy.

01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:41.230
媽咪 是女巫
Mommy! It's the witch!

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:42.860
你做了什麼？
What have you done?

01:46:43.110 --> 01:46:44.110
-媽　-媽咪
-Mom! -Mommy!

01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:45.320
等等 兒子
Wait! Boys!

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:46.900
沒事…
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:48.200
我是你們媽媽
I'm your mother!

01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:52.200
不准靠近他們
Get away from them.

01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:54.790
媽
Mom!

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.500
不
No.

01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:57.620
還沒
Not yet.

01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.330
媽咪
Mommy!

01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:00.670
別碰我們媽媽
Get away from our mom!

01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:01.920
-你不是我們的真媽媽　-住手
-You're not our real mom! -Hey, boys. Stop.

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.960
-拜託…　-滾出我們家
-Please. Please. -Get out of our house!

01:47:04.130 --> 01:47:04.960
兒子 住手
Boys, stop it.

01:47:05.130 --> 01:47:06.630
你不是我們媽媽　-出去
-You're not our mom! -Get out!

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.880
-走開　-快走
-Go away! -Go!

01:47:08.050 --> 01:47:09.470
住手
Stop it!

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:19.770
拜託別傷害我們
Please don't hurt us.

01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:21.190
求求你
Please.

01:47:22.150 --> 01:47:23.940
我絕對不會傷害你們
I would never hurt you.

01:47:24.110 --> 01:47:25.110
絕對不會
Never.

01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:29.070
我絕對不會傷害任何人
I would never hurt anyone.

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:30.900
我不是怪物
I'm not a monster.

01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:32.360
我是…
I'm a...

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:37.290
我是…
I'm...

01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.420
對不起
I'm sorry.

01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:55.510
媽
Mom!

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.310
-你還好嗎？　-嗨
-Are you okay? -Hi.

01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:59.600
嗨 沒事
Hi. Okay.

01:47:59.770 --> 01:48:00.770
我沒事
I'm okay.

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.270
我沒事
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:17.990
-媽 不要去　-媽 不要
-Mom, don't go. Don't go. -No, Mom. Don't.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.120
-沒關係　-媽
-It's okay. -Mom.

01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:21.080
沒關係
It's okay. It's okay.

01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:04.290
有人會愛他們的
Know that they'll be loved.

01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:46.290
現在呢？
What now?

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:47.790
離開這裡
Get out of here.

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:49.590
我再去找你
I'll find you.

01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:00.260
我們該走了 快
We have to go. Now!

01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:14.570
我打開了黑暗神書
I opened the Darkhold.

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:17.570
必須把它闔上
I have to close it.

01:50:20.370 --> 01:50:23.410
沒有人會再受黑暗神書誘惑了
No one will ever be tempted by the Darkhold again.

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.500
你還好嗎？
You all right?

01:51:10.170 --> 01:51:11.790
-結束了嗎？　-對
-Is it over? -Yeah.

01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:13.630
阿美莉卡沒事吧？
Is America okay?

01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:15.750
她正要過來接我們
She's on her way here to get us.

01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.220
旺達呢？
Wanda?

01:51:21.010 --> 01:51:22.010
沒有
No.

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.900
她摧毀了每個宇宙的黑暗神書
So she destroyed the Darkhold in every universe.

01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:38.440
她做對了
She did the right thing.

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:41.410
沒錯
Yeah, she did.

01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:51.250
你的宇宙是什麼樣子？
What's your universe like?

01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:54.710
非常美
It's very beautiful.

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.470
真希望我能帶你去看
I wish I could show you.

01:52:05.550 --> 01:52:06.890
我很想去
I'd really like that.

01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:14.480
-但我該走了　-對
-But I have to go. -Yeah.

01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:16.980
我知道
Yeah, I know.

01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:22.200
太可惜了
It's too bad, though.

01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:26.410
原本可能會有一次對撞事件
Could've been one hell of an Incursion.

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:31.250
我愛你
I love you.

01:52:34.330 --> 01:52:37.040
我在每個宇宙都愛你
I love you in every universe.

01:52:41.090 --> 01:52:44.380
我也想關心一個人或有人來關心我
It's not that I don't wanna care for someone or have someone care for me.

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:45.760
只是…
It's just...

01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:50.470
我很害怕
I get scared.

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:51.640
是
Yeah.

01:52:54.730 --> 01:52:56.150
是啊
Yeah.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.490
面對你的恐懼
Face your fears...

01:53:11.250 --> 01:53:13.160
奇異博士
Doctor Strange.

01:53:43.820 --> 01:53:46.910
這怎麼比多重宇宙傳送還要難？
How is this so much harder than a Multiversal portal?

01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:51.410
她需要放慢腳步 更有耐心
She needs to slow down and be more patient.

01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:55.120
讓我想起另一個學生
Reminds me of another student I knew.

01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:58.960
感覺如何？
How you feeling?

01:53:59.590 --> 01:54:00.590
為何這麼問？
Why do you ask?

01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:05.510
你用黑暗神書夢行到自己的屍體裡
You used the Darkhold to Dreamwalk into your own corpse.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:08.180
對喔
Yeah, right, that.

01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:10.180
沒事
Fine.

01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:14.310
我倒是想問你一件事
But I do wanna ask you something.

01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:17.230
你幸福嗎？
Are you happy?

01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:20.440
這問題…
That's a...

01:54:20.610 --> 01:54:21.730
有意思
interesting question.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:26.110
原本以為拯救世界會獲得幸福
You'd think that saving the world would get you there...

01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:27.990
並沒有
but it doesn't.

01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:35.450
有時我忍不住會幻想其他宇宙的生活
Sometimes, I do wonder about my other lives.

01:54:36.830 --> 01:54:39.290
但我還是很感恩在這裡
Yet I remain grateful in this one.

01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:42.090
即使有種種苦難
Even with its tribulations.

01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:46.760
至少我們不必獨自面對
At least we don't have to go through it alone, huh?

01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:48.010
沒錯
No, we don't.

01:55:00.150 --> 01:55:01.150
等一下
Wait.

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:04.570
你好
'Sup?

01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:05.730
你好
'Sup.

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:08.360
我創造了一些火花
Made some sparks.

01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.990
很好
Great.

01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:12.200
你的雙親會很驕傲
Your parents would be proud.

01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.280
希望以後她們能看到
I hope you'll get to show 'em one day.

01:55:15.370 --> 01:55:16.410
史蒂芬
Stephen.

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:23.340
我很高興落入你的宇宙
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

01:55:25.300 --> 01:55:26.590
我也很高興 小鬼
So am I, kid.

01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.970
我也很高興
So am I.

01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:46.160
奇異博士2：失控多重宇宙

01:58:55.670 --> 01:58:57.010
奇異博士？
Doctor Strange?

01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:01.600
有什麼事嗎？
Can I help you?

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.720
你引發對撞事件
You caused an Incursion...

01:59:03.890 --> 01:59:05.520
我們必須解決
and we're gonna fix it.

01:59:14.230 --> 01:59:15.690
除非你怕了
Unless you're afraid.

01:59:20.570 --> 01:59:21.870
一點也不怕
Not in the least.

02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:53.380
潤色：Seethrough
翻譯：Aaron Wu
雙語合併：James、xz

02:05:56.930 --> 02:06:00.510
（奇異博士將再回歸）

02:06:13.490 --> 02:06:14.700
結束了
It's over！
